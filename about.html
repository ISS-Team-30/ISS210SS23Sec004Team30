                        <p>We are given food that is very low quality. This is caused by the way it is grown, processed, and distributed-mass production. Because the way it's grown it is now affecting the planet and its people. </p>
                        <p>Food quality is a major factor in many of the problems of our industrialized society. This issue is important because it affects all of us. We all are affected by low food quality due to Mass production of crops. This is due to the overuse of pesticides and toxic chemicals.Having so many chemicals being added to the crops, the soil is now extremely deprived of nutrients and so is the food that we consume. The food that is consumed the most is the food that is the most grown. To mass produce these highly demanded crops, chemicals are used. The way it's grown affected the soil because the chemicals used kill the microorganisms ecosystems in the soil that bring nutrients to the crops. The absence of these microorganisms leads to the crops being extremely low in nutrients that we consume. Mass production of an extremely small range of crops also affected the soil. This is because these few kinds of crops deplete the soil of what little ecosystems and nutrients are left without restoring the soil. After all of the nutrients are used up the areas of land are left deserted. This affects food quality because when the soil can no longer be restored to its original state for it to bring another harvest. For more plantations, the soil needs to be restored for it to produce quality food. This happens because there is not enough plant diversity to be able to restore the soil for another harvest. The kind of plants planted determines the quality of the soil which also determines the quality of the crops grown. In order to have quality food you have to plant a wide range of different kinds of crops to be able to restore the soil diversity of microorganisms that bring in a wide range of nutrients for the plants to use. The wide range of crops leads to a wide range of microorganisms which increases the quality of the food grown.</p>
                        <p>Our industrialized society has affected our food quality due to the mass production of food. With so many chemicals being added to crops, the solid is now extremely deprived of nutrients and so is the food that we are eating. In order for this to be reversed we have to make a change in our diet. The change in our diet will encourage farmers to plant more diversely and help restore the destroyed ecosystem. By engaging in this journey to better food quality our food will become much denser in its quality making us much wealthier in our health. Therefore I encourage you to join us on this journey for the future to improve our food quality.</p>
