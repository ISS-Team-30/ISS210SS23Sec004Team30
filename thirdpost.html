                        <p> Climate change is causing more extreme weather events such as droughts and floods, which can damage crops and reduce their nutritional value.</p>
                        <p> It can also cause changes in temperature, precipitation patterns and rising carbon dioxide levels due to human activity, which can alter the timing of harvests and the way crops grow.</p>
                        <p>All of these factors can make it harder for farmers to produce high-quality, nutritious food.</p>
                        <p> As mentioned in the video, according to Kristie Ebi, when plants have higher carbon dioxide it increases the synthesis of carbohydrates, sugars and starches, and they decrease the concentrations of protein and critical nutrients.</p>
                        <p> These vitamins and nutrients are essential to our health and consuming plants that absorb these rising levels of CO2 puts us at risk for all kinds of health affects such as iron deficiency anemia and lack of protein.. These rising levels of CO2 have nearly doubled since the start of the industrial revolution and a solution for this would be to decrease greenhouse gases through the use of fossil fuels and adopting more sustainable diets such as less meat consumption could lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which would overall lead to better health for you and our community.

                        <p>Each blog post should include an image and a pdf or a video. Included in the following lines is the code for including an image. In the link below, include your pdf. The image is the source, labeled src below. You simply have to follow the directory path to replace the image. The directory path as is is stating you will find this image if you go to assets, then image, and there you will find the image I have called. This must be the exact path. Changing punctutation or capitalization will mean the site cannot find your picture. Remember, machines are incredibly literal.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/handstoheart.jpeg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">This is how you add captions under an image. Cite your image here. You may also say something about it, if you like.</span>
                        <p>Just like a quote, you should not leave an image resting there. Say something about what the image does for your site.</p>
                        <p>Finally, you may also include a video. Not every member has to do all three. Choose whether you want a video to cite and unpack or a PDF. If it is a video, you only need to include the video and information about it (your summary). If it is a PDF, you should include a picture.</p>
